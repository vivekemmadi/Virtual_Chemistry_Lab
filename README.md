# 🧪 Virtual Chemistry Lab

Welcome to the **Virtual Chemistry Lab**! This is a digital simulation tool designed for students and educators to perform and record chemistry experiments virtually — no actual chemicals required! 🧬🧫

---

## 💡 Project Description

This project is a **digital chemistry lab** where users can:

🔹 Add different types of **flasks** to the virtual workspace  
🧪 Use a **dropper** to add various **elements** into flasks  
📏 Set and control the **quantity** of each element added  
🌡️ Adjust the **temperature** using **Heat 🔥** and **Cool ❄️** buttons  
🎨 Change the **color** of the solution to observe visual reactions  
📝 Record every action in the **experiment notes** section  
📤 **Submit** the entire experiment including each step performed

## 🔧 Features

- Interactive drag-and-drop interface for flasks and elements
- Real-time updates to the experiment as reactions occur
- Dynamic temperature control for heating and cooling
- Step-by-step experiment logging and summary submission
- Clean, user-friendly UI for educational use

---

## 📚 Use Cases

- Ideal for **virtual chemistry classrooms**
- Can be used for **school science projects**
- Helps in **visualizing chemical processes** safely and creatively

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
